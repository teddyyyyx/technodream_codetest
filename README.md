# Technodream Code Test

## My Exam Reflection:

In my web development exam, I chose Flexbox for layout since the task wasn't complex enough to require Grid. Although SVG would have been better for icons and buttons due to its smaller file size and background transparency support, the instructions required JPG images. To work around this, I cropped the image of the button from the sample website given to me using GIMP and applied it as a background image in my CSS using the `background-image` property.

I also added minimal responsiveness using media queries for the navbar and main content to make it responsive across all modern viewports. JavaScript was necessary for the navbar burger menu, where I implemented a toggle feature that adds and removes an active class, with CSS controlling the styles for that class.

The website is hosted in github pages for easy live viewing.

## Instructions:

1. The website should be coded and validated in HTML5 and CSS3, using a table-less layout.
2. All fonts are in Arial.
3. The photos, logo, icons, and navigation/send buttons should be in **.jpg** image format.
4. Feel free to integrate any JavaScript, PHP, etc., to show off your skills; however, this is optional.
5. Do not use free-built templates (e.g., Bootstrap).
6. You can also program its responsiveness for mobile view (optional).
